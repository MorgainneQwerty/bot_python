I recommend using Jupyter.

2 examples of simple bots.
Pyautogui to open programs (login/password) and Selenium to use on the internet (login/password).

You need these resources to be able to use the bot:

1 - Install Pyautogui.
2 - Install Selenium.
3 - Install Chrome -> chromedriver
            Firefox -> geckodriver 
4 - Place the file inside the anaconda3>python.exe folder.
